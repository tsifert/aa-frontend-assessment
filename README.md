Instructions

Create a React application to implement the provided mockup.
Fetch data from the following endpoint: << hidden >>
When an image is clicked, update the right side with the associated image data.
When a tab is clicked, show the following data:
"Recently Added": Sort images by createdAt
"Favorited": Show images which have been favorited.
The user should be able to both favorite and delete an image.
These changes should persist until the page is reloaded.
Consider reusable, composable components when implementing the mockup.
Code can use class components or hooks.
Deploy to a server that can be accessed over the internet. You can use any host of
your choosing, such as AWS, GCP, Heroku, Vercel, etc. Be sure to include the URL in
your submission.
Host the code on a public repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
